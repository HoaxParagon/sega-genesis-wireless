#### sega-genesis-wireless  
the files to make a wireless controller pair for the Sega Genesis  

#### PLANS  
will have a 3d printed body  

is wireless, uses RF24L01  

~~will be using a joystick for the left side D-pad~~  

I dropped the idea of an joystick for D-pad when I changed the in/out of the radio to a single state byte.  

I may decide on doing a version with the joystick for a more universal appeal but not today.  

no plans right now to implement XYZ buttons. NOTE: my controllers have xyz but I won't be interfacing with them  

pressing all three buttons, ABC, together will reset/calibrate joystick  

#### NOTES  
should work now, it's so far untested. I'm waiting to be able to modify a geniune controller due to the connectors.  
probably won't work quite right though
