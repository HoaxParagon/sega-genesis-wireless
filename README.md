#### sega-genesis-wireless  
the files to make a wireless controller pair for the Sega Genesis  

#### PLANS  
will have a 3d printed body  
is wireless, uses RF24L01  
will be using a joystick for the left side D-pad  
no plans right now to implement XYZ buttons  
pressing all three buttons, ABC, together will reset/calibrate joystick  

#### NOTES  
should work now, it's so far untested. I'm waiting to be able to modify a geniune controller due to the connectors.  
probably won't work quite right though
